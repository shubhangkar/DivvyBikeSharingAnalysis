# DivvyBikeSharingAnalysis
To perform data analysis and processing on the Divvy bike sharing system using Python 

For this project, we have taken the bike sharing program in Chicago, put in place by Divvy. We will analyze the trends observed on the program. We will also look at factors like weather conditions, temperature in perticular, and holiday season that effect usage trends of the subscribed and the un-subscribed users.

Finally based on the analysis, we have provided a few recomendations to optimize bike usage, expand bike docking locations, and share details on bike dock hot spots that local business can make use of to promote thier businesses by evaluating these high density transit points.
